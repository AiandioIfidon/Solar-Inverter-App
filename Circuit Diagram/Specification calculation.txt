For the switching relay;
3.3v GPIO to switch a 5v relay using 2n2222 transistor

2n2222 transistor collector current is 800mA with a current gain of 30 to 300hfe, meaning the trigger current needed with be between (800/30)mA to (800/300)mA.
This means the trigger current with be between 26.7mA to 2.67mA. For now lets just go with 20mA.

With 3.3v from the GPIO pin and 'R' for the resistor value to get the 20mA current.
V = IR, R = V/I
Therefore, R = 3.3V / 0.02A = 165 ohms
using 200ohms for the resistor we get a current of ;
I = V/R
I = 3.3/0.2 = 16.5mA with is between 26.7mA and 2.67mA.
Therefore, for the resistor I will be using a 200ohms resistor.
